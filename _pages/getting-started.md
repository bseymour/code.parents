You could read up on the classics of education theory: [Piaget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget's_theory_of_cognitive_development), [Vygotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development) and [Bruner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding), but my summary is:

> # Go from where they are <br/>to where you want them to be. <br/>Go from the concrete to the abstract.

Along with a few lines from Dorothy Nolte:

>"...If a child lives with praise,
they learn to appreciate.
If a child lives with encouragement,
they learn confidence...."


Growing self-confidence, and enabling a child to feel that they are in an encouraging and safe environment, in which they are able to explore and make mistakes, is an essential foundation for all learning and development activities, whatever you are trying to achieve.

>If you believe you can,
or you believe you can’t,
you are probably right.
(Henry Ford).

Start simple - make it work, then add complexity.  
Start where they are comfortable, then draw them out into new areas.

Be actively on the lookout for any spark of interest, be it music , art, games, maths, and use these to draw them into coding. I’ve been running coding clubs in Primary Schools for 4 years (I’m also a former High School Physics Teacher), and have children aged 10 & 7 both of whom have enjoyed exploring coding in various forms  - the examples below are drawn from these experiences:
